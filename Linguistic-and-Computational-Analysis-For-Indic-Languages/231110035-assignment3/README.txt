I have combined the solutions for Q1 and Q2 and put the solutions in the directory named '1,2'
For Q3, I have made a pdf which is stored in the directory '3'.
Also, I have stored the outputs of all the translations in the directory named 'Outputs'

Example: To see how the NLLB model worked on task of translating from English to Marathi,
Open the file path: "Outputs\1-a\predictions_en_mr.txt"
The text documents are named in the following manner:

predictions_<source lang>_<target lang>.txt
